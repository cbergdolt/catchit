This repository contains slightly modified source code for the catchit job saver database application presented at 
https://sites.google.com/view/carolynbergdolt/coding-projects/catchit

Parts of the code have been redacted, as they contain usernames and passwords my team used to access the SQL database. 
I have redacted these pieces in a relatively clear manner, and this code should be mostly usable with a few minor modifications.
