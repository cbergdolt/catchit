This repository contains slightly modified source code for the catchit job saver database application presented at 
https://sites.google.com/view/carolynbergdolt/coding-projects/catchit

Parts of the code have been redacted, as they contain usernames and passwords my team used to access the SQL database. 
I have redacted these pieces in a relatively clear manner, and this code should be mostly usable with a few minor modifications.

Each redacted piece of information has been replated with the word redacted, and a comment has been placed at the end of the line, indicating the nature of the redacted information. In the case that multiple things have been redacted in a line, the comment contains comma-separated descriptions.
